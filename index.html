			Hello! My name is Peter Michalakis. I am a twenty-five year old Brooklyn native and a full-stack web developer.
			<br>
			Some of the skills I have gleaned so far are: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Javascript, jQuery, Git, Sinatra, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Backbone and Skeleton. I am always eager to learn more skills and to improve upon my already existing set of knowledge.
			<br>
			Outside of web development, some of my interests/hobbies are cutlery, horology, Lego, absurd housewares and all manner of sports - watching and playing.
			<br>
			I am a Jets/Mets/Knicks/Rangers/New York Red Bulls fan - a source of constant dismay in my life.

				<div id="fisticuffsexpanded">
					Fisticuffs is a Tinder analogue for fist-fighting.
					<br>
					It functions in much the same way as Tinder, a user logs in with his/her Facebook account and gives Fisticuffs permission to access/publish his/her information and profile picture.
					<br>
					An account is then created for the user, using his/her name, date of birth and profile picture. The user can then add details significant to fist-fighting, such as height, weight, location and a short bio.
					<br>
					The user is presented with a series of other users' profiles, where they can decided that they would either like to fight the other user, or not. If two users decide to fight one another, they receive notifications alerting them they've matched, and can send one another messages. Users are also notified each time they receive new messages from matched users.

			<br>
				<div id="swellexpanded">
					Swell is a sentiment mapper, built using Twitter's API. A user enters a term or hash tag and Swell searches Twitter for relevant tweets. Swell isolates every word in every one of those tweets and assigns each word a score, based on the positivity or negativity of those words. Swell then totals the positivity/negativity score and displays that value along a sort of thermometer.
					<br>
					Underneath that, Swell displays the most influential tweet about the searched term, gauged by favorites, followers and retweets.
					<br>
					Swell also displays a word cloud of the most commonly occuring words within the tweets, excluding nondemonstrative words, such as "a," "the," or "and," and the searched term itself.
